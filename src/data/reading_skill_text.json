            "text" : "I had dreamed of visiting the Lost City for years. It was a mysterious ancient city that had been hidden deep in the jungle for centuries.\n\nFinally, I arrived at the small airport in the middle of the jungle. I was excited and nervous at the same time.\n\nA group of men met me at the airport and took me to the city. The drive was long and bumpy, but it was worth it.\n\nThe city was even more amazing than I had imagined. It was built of stone, and it was surrounded by a high wall. The buildings were tall and narrow, and they were covered in intricate carvings.\n\nI spent the next few days exploring the city. I met the people who lived there, and I learned about their culture.\n\nI spent a week in the Lost City, and I learned a lot about myself and about the world.\n\nIt was time for me to leave, but I knew that I would never forget my time in the Lost City."
